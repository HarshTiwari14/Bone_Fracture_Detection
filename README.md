# Bone Fracture Detection 🦴

## Overview
This project implements a deep-learning-based system for detecting bone fractures from medical images. It uses a Jupyter notebook (`Bone_Fracture4.ipynb`) as the core of the workflow.

## Features
- Load and preprocess X-ray or imaging data of bones  
- Build/train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify fracture vs. no-fracture  
- Visualize results and performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix)  
- Easy to experiment and extend for related medical-imaging classification tasks  

## Tech Stack
- Python (3.x)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Common libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch if you prefer)  
- Git versioned code on GitHub  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install Python (3.7 or later recommended)  
- Ensure you have `pip` or `conda` available  

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
